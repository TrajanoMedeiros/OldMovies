This project is a web application developed in PHP, designed to allow users to watch classic movies that are no longer under copyright protection. The goal is to preserve and share historical films that have become part of the public domain, making them easily accessible to everyone.

The system works by loading a list of public domain movies stored in a M3U playlist, which is dynamically read and displayed on the website. Each movie entry includes the title, year of release, poster image, and a built-in video player for streaming directly from the browser.

The front-end is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a simple and responsive interface. The PHP backend handles data management, video loading, and dynamic content generation, allowing easy updates to the movie list without modifying the core structure of the site.

In the future, the project could include features like search filters, categories by decade or genre, and a recommendation system to help users explore forgotten cinematic gems.

Overall, this project aims to combine technology and cultural preservation, offering an educational and entertaining platform for movie enthusiasts and historians alike.
